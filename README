Cross platform navigation controller for Appcelerator Titanium.
It is a mobile app that displays a series of windows in an easily navigable stack.

This is my version of the Cross-Platform NavigationController written by
Kevin Whinnery

This version uses events to manipulate window stack. This insures sequential window closing and opening. Kevin's version was causing an unexpected shutdown of the app when invoking home() function on a stack of 3+ windows. The windows were closed all at the same time, not sequentially.

In addition, I created new method openFromHome(). It allows opening new windows from the 'root' window. I believe this method is very useful for 'dashboard' applications.
